                    <Run Text=": Is a cylindrical dielectric waveguide where  a high index wave guiding core is surrounded by a low index cladding. Optical fibers are usually made of silica (SiO2) glass.   The core can be doped with  Germania or alumina for a slightly higher index than that of silica cladding.  The index step is controlled by the concentration and distribution of dopants. Silica fibers due to their low loss and dispersion are utilized for light transmission in the visible and near infrared regions.  Hence they are widely used for optical communications and most laser applications in the range of the spectrum.  Optical fibers have a wide range of applications, owing to their low losses and large bandwidths the most important applications are fiber optic communications and interconnections. Other important applications include fiber sensors, guided optical imaging, remote monitoring and medical applications. "/>
