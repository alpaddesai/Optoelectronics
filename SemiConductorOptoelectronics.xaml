                    <Run Text="is a device that converts an optical signal into another form , an electrical signal either current or voltage for the most part.  All photo detectors respond to power and intensity of the optical signal.  The response is a function of optical wavelength with a cutoff at long wavelengths.   They can be designed to have a high response speed capable of following fast optical signals and for this reason photon detectors are suitable for detecting optical signals in photonic systems. They are classified into two groups:  external photoelectric effect and the internal photoelectric effect. Photo detectors based on an external photoelectric effect are photo emissive devices and photo detectors based on an  internal photoelectric effect are semiconductor devices, in which electron hole pairs are generated through the absorption of incident photons.   Categories of semiconductor device include photoconductors, junction photodiodes, photovoltaic devices, photo transistors and charge coupled devices.   Concepts are similar, photo detector noise consists of quantum noise, shot noise and thermal noise.   Several parameters are commonly used to define the performance characteristics of  photo detectors these parameters include spectral response and quantum efficiency.  "/>
